# What's Next? - Yeoman Generator

> Experimental Yeoman generator for your next and next-gen web project - lets you quickly set up a project with the next technologies in mind.

This generator is coded in [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). It uses this as a hook, as to avoid any overhead in creating the generator.

## Usage

Install `yo`, `grunt-cli`, and `generator-whats-next`:

```
npm i -g yo grunt-cli generator-whats-next
```

Or you could clone the generator:

```
git clone https://github.com/katallaxie/generator-whats-next
```

Enter the directory:

```
cd generator-whats-next
```

And, link the generator locally:

```
npm link
```

You should then be able to use the generator as follows:

```
yo whats-next
```
